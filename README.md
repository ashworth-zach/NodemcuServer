# NodemcuServer
super simple server that I plan on adding stuff to.

Changes:
* added websocket support to esp8266, and added a localhost node/express server to communicate back and forth.


To use:
* flash esp8266 with webServer.ino
* run npm install
* node server.js
* You will have to change your ssid and password, along with the ip address of your esp8266.
